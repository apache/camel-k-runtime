Health Apache Camel K Runtime example
======================================

This repository contains an Apache Camel-K Runtime application that expose `/health` endpoint to gather Camel context status.

In order to run it:
```bash
mvn clean exec:java
```
while it is running (from another terminal) you can access the rest camel route exposed through the servlet with:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
if the camel context has started properly that should get `OK`.
