======================================

This repository contains an Apache Camel-K Runtime application that expose a `rest` endpoint and and `/health` endpoint to gather Camel context status.

In order to run it:
[code,shell]

while it is running (from another terminal) you can access to:

* health info with:
+
[code,shell]
----
http http://localhost:8080/health
----
+
if the camel context has started properly that should get:
+
[code,json]
----
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "context",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "route:route1",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "route:route2",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "status": "UP"
}
